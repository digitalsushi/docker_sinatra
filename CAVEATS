# SHELL NEEDS ADMIN
i think we need to run docker with this in the session

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Unrestricted

or else it will say it cannot connect to the daemon.

# MUST DECLARE SHARED DRIVES IN DOCKER CONFIG

Before you can mount a host directory, you must allow the drive in the docker config.

# AUTO RESTART ISSUES

We use a ruby gem called rerun to locate file changes and restart the server
automatically. This uses inotify, but we're loading the mounted Docker volume 
over SMB which of course, does not support this (readily. It's apparently coming soon).

So if you change a file from the host, the rerun feature will not notice it. Just click the 'r'
button in the main server task and it will restart itself from there.
